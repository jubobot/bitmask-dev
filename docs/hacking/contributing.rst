  limited in how many forks they can have, so if this is a problem for you,
  file a `support ticket`_ or fork the code from the `github mirror`_.

Coding conventions

* Git messages should be informative.
* There is a pre-commit hook ready to be used in the ``docs/hooks`` folder,
  alongside some other hooks to do autopep8 on each commit.

Dependencies
----------------------------------

We try hard not to introduce any new dependencies at this moment. If you really
have to, the packages bitmask depends on have to be specified *both* in the
setup.py and the pip requirements file.

Don't introduce any pinning in the setup.py file, they should go in the
requirements files (mainly ``pkg/requirements.pip``).


Signing your commits
---------------------------------

For contributors with commit access, you **should** sign all your commits. If
you are merging some code from external contributors, you should sign their
commits.

For handy alias for sign and signoff commits from external contributors add to
your gitconfig::

  [alias]
  # Usage: git signoff-rebase [base-commit]
  signoff-rebase = "!GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR='sed -i -re s/^pick/e/' sh -c 'git rebase -i $1 && while test -f .git/rebase-merge/interactive; do git commit --amend --signoff --no-edit && git rebase --continue; done' -"

Merging code
---------------------------------

We avoid merge commits into master, they make a very messy history. Put this
in your gitconfig to only allow the merges that can be resolved as a
fast-forward::

  [merge]
  ff = only
